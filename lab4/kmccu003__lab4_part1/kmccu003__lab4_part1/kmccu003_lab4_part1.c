/*A car has a fuel-level sensor that sets PA3..PA0 to a value between 0 (empty) and 15 (full).
A series of LEDs connected to PC5..PC0 should light to graphically indicate the fuel level.
If the fuel level is 1 or 2, PC5 lights. If the level is 3 or 4, PC5 and PC4 light.
Level 5-6 lights PC5..PC3. 7-9 lights PC5..PC2. 10-12 lights PC5..PC1. 13-15 lights PC5..PC0.
Also, PC6 connects to a "Low fuel" icon, which should light if the level is 4 or less.
(The example below shows the display for a fuel level of 3).*/

/*PB0 and PB1 each connect to an LED, and PB0's LED is initially on.
Pressing a button connected to PA0 turns off PB0's LED and turns on PB1's LED,
staying that way after button release. Pressing the button again turns off PB1's LED and
turns on PB0's LED.*/
